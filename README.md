🗜️ Text Compressor using Huffman Coding (C++)

       A C++ implementation of text compression using the Huffman coding algorithm. 
       This project provides functionality for compressing text input, decompressing it 
       back to its original form, and searching for character-specific information.


✨ Features

    1. Text Compression — Compress user-provided text using Huffman coding

    2. Text Decompression — Restore compressed text back to original form

    3. Character Search —
       • Find frequency of a specific character
       • Look up Huffman code of a specific character


🚀 Prerequisites

• C++ compiler with C++11 support or higher.

• Standard Template Library (STL).
