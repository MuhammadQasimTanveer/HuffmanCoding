🗜️ Text Compressor using Huffman Coding (C++)

A C++ implementation of text compression using the Huffman coding algorithm.


This project provides functionality for compressing text input, decompressing it 

back to its original form, and searching for character-specific information.



✨ Features


🔹 Text Compression — Compress user-provided text using Huffman coding

🔹 Text Decompression — Restore compressed text back to original form

🔹 Character Search —

• Find frequency of a specific character

• Look up Huffman code of a specific character



🚀 Prerequisites

• C++ compiler with C++11 support or higher

• Standard Template Library (STL)
